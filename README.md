## About my laraveldaily-shop

There is simple CRUD shop app built in laravel 8, inspired by several [Laraveldaily courses](https://laraveldaily.teachable.com/courses/ ) about basic features of Laravel framework. There are users, but mainly categories and products (and ratings under construction). <br/>
You will find respective Models, Controllers, views. <br/>
That's master branch. <br/>
On other branches, I practice other topics inspired by respective [Laraveldaily course](https://laraveldaily.teachable.com/courses/ ), <br/>
such as testing branch inspired by testing course, and etc..

## Building the app on your local machine 
There are several options to build the app on your local machine. <br/>
- Laravel sail <br/>
I built on Windows Home 10 with WSL2 and docker, using  [laravel sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail ) <br/>
You can take a look at README-laravel-sail-setup.md for more instructions.<br/>
- XAMP <br/>
XAMP option is available as well. <br/>
You can take a look at README-xamp-setup.md for more instructions.<br/>
